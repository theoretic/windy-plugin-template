# XCGram — Windy.com sounding plugin for pilots

An interactive **aerological sounding** (Skew-T log-P) for Windy.com, built for
free-flight and cross-country pilots. It draws the vertical profile at any point
you click and — the part that matters — **explains every feature in plain
language**: where the cumulus base sits, how high thermals will go, whether the
day is capped by an inversion, how strong and sheared the wind is, and what the
CAPE/CIN numbers mean for your flight. It can also paint those derived values as
**colour overlays across the map**.

## Tabs

The right-hand panel has three tabs. The **model selector** and **forecast time
scale** are shared by Diagram and Layers, so both stay on the same model and
hour. The scale is a scrollable strip of **clickable hour labels** grouped by day
(24-hour clock, **1-hour step**) — click any label to jump to that time, use the
`‹` / `›` buttons or the ←/→ keys to step, and the picked hour stays centred.
Hours outside the soarable window (before 06 and from 21) are dimmed. On open, a
sounding is auto-loaded for the **map centre** so the timeline is live before you
click anything.

### Diagram

- **Skew-T log-P** with skewed isotherms, dry & moist adiabats, mixing-ratio
  lines, environmental temperature (red) and dew point (blue), a lifted surface
  **parcel** (green), and wind barbs.
- **Markers** for cumulus cloud base (LCL) and thermal top (EL).
- **Cloud-development layer** (toggle ☁️): a light-grey bunch of circles per humid
  layer, centred on the pressure axis. Circle count and opacity scale with
  cloudiness; the bunch's vertical extent mirrors the cloud-layer thickness.
- **Thermal-activity column** (toggle 🔥): stacked 100 m bars on the pressure axis
  whose length and colour follow the local environmental lapse rate — red where
  it's dry-adiabatic or steeper (unstable), green through inversions (stable).
- Both helper layers are **on by default** (buttons floated right in the controls
  row) and are **pinned to the left boundary at any zoom**: constant screen size
  horizontally, vertically tracking the zoomed height scale.
- **Combined axis labels** — each pressure gridline is labelled
  `1870m / 797hPa`, heights interpolated from the live profile, with a dark text
  halo so they stay readable over the helper layers.
- **Hover readout**: height, pressure, temperature, dew point and wind at the
  cursor; flips sides near the right edge so it never leaves the pane.
- **Zoom & pan**: mouse wheel (zoom about cursor), pinch (touch), drag to pan in
  both directions, double-click or the ⤢ button to reset. Zoom is a uniform
  affine transform, so curve **inclinations stay fixed** at any scale.
- **Explanation cards** for cloud base, thermal top, CAPE, CIN, trigger
  temperature, freezing level, inversions, boundary-layer wind, wind shear and a
  thermal-strength estimate — each colour-coded and expandable into *what it is*
  and *why it matters in the air*. The CAPE card adds ⛈️ pictograms: none under
  1000 J/kg, then one per extra 500 J/kg (capped at five).

### Layers

Colours the map with values computed by the plugin from soundings sampled across
the current view. Six layers:

| Layer | Scale |
|-------|-------|
| Cloud base | red (low) → blue (high) |
| Thermal top | red (low) → blue (high) |
| Inversion strength | red (weak) → blue (strong) |
| Thermal activity | transparent → red |
| CAPE | transparent → red |
| Thermal clouds | transparent → grey (α = condensation likelihood below the thermal top) |

Controls: layer picker, grid size **S / M / L** (8×6 / 12×9 / 16×12 points),
**AGL/MSL** toggle for the height layers, a **Compute overlay** button, an opacity
slider and a legend.

> **How it works.** Windy keeps only the *active* overlay's data on the client,
> so sounding-derived fields can't be read per map pixel. Instead the plugin
> samples a coarse grid over the viewport — **one meteogram fetch per grid point**
> (concurrency-limited, cached per ~0.1° bucket) — paints the result into a small
> canvas and places it as an `L.ImageOverlay` that the browser upscales smoothly.
> Changing the **time** re-derives from cache (no network); only changing the
> viewport, grid size or model re-samples. A wide view at **L** is ~192 fetches —
> start small.

### Guide

An in-panel field guide to reading a Windy sounding: diagram elements,
forecasting convection, convection-layer thickness and cloud base / condensation
level, plus a quick workflow.

## Outdated-data warning

The plugin records the model run its data came from (`header.updateTs`) and
compares it against the model's latest published run, read live from
`@windy/products` (`products[model].calendar.updateTs`, no refetch, re-checked
each minute). When a newer run exists it shows an amber **"data outdated — refresh
advised"** banner with a **Refresh** button that re-fetches in place (no page
reload) and invalidates the map overlay.

## Data

Profiles come from Windy's own forecast via `@windy/fetch`
(`getMeteogramForecastData`) — temperature, dew point, wind and geopotential
height at the standard pressure levels (1000…150 hPa) plus the surface. No API
key is needed; the plugin only runs on the windy.com domain. Derived quantities
(LCL, CAPE/CIN, parcel ascent, etc.) are computed locally in `src/lib/thermo.ts`
using standard parcel theory (Bolton 1980).

### 1-hour time step

The plugin mirrors the native Windy sounding's behaviour (verified against the
windy.com client code):

- It requests `step: 1` when the account has a subscription
  (`@windy/subscription.hasAny()`). **Genuine 1-hour data is a Premium feature**,
  gated server-side on the session token — free accounts are served 3-hour data
  regardless of the requested step.
- The native sounding then follows the 1-hour timeline by **linearly
  interpolating every level between the two bracketing forecast profiles**. The
  plugin does the same (`interpolateTo1h` in `src/lib/windyData.ts`), so the
  scale reads 1 h on any account; it is a no-op when the payload is already
  hourly.
- Map overlays deliberately stay on 3-hour fetches to keep grid payloads small;
  a nearest-profile lookup bridges the step mismatch.

## Install (hosted)

The plugin is built and published to GitHub Pages automatically. To use it, just
load this URL in Windy — no build, no local server:

1. Open **https://www.windy.com/developer-mode**.
2. Load the plugin URL:
   ```
   https://theoretic.github.io/XCGram/plugin.min.js
   ```
3. It opens on the map centre; **click anywhere** (or right-click → *XCGram*) to
   load the sounding for another point.

Pages serves over HTTPS with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, which is what
Windy's cross-origin loader requires. The sibling `plugin.json` (config) is
deployed alongside the bundle at the same path.

## Develop & run locally

```bash
npm install      # one-time; pulls build tooling + d3
npm start        # builds in watch mode, serves https://localhost:9999/plugin.js
```

### TLS certificate (do this once)

Windy.com (public HTTPS) loads the plugin from `https://localhost:9999`
cross-origin. The dev cert bundled with `@windycom/plugin-devtools` has **no
Subject Alternative Name**, so Chromium (Edge/Chrome) rejects it even if trusted.
Issue a proper localhost cert with [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert):

```bash
mkcert -install
mkcert -cert-file certs/localhost.pem -key-file certs/localhost-key.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

`rollup.config.js` automatically uses `certs/localhost.pem` when present (else it
falls back to the bundled cert). `mkcert -install` trusts the CA in Windows **and**
Firefox. `certs/` is git-ignored. The dev server also sends
`Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true` for browsers' Private Network Access
checks.

### Load into Windy

1. Open **https://localhost:9999/plugin.js** once — the padlock should be clean
   (no warning). If it warns, the cert step above didn't take.
2. Go to **https://www.windy.com/developer-mode** and load
   `https://localhost:9999/plugin.js`.
3. The plugin opens on the map centre; **click anywhere** (or right-click →
   *XCGram*) to load the sounding for another point.

## Build & deploy

Build the distributable bundle locally:

```bash
npm run build        # macOS/Linux
npm run build:win    # Windows
```

Outputs `dist/` containing `plugin.min.js` (the production bundle), `plugin.js`
(+ sourcemap), `plugin.json` (compiled config) and `package.json`.

### Automatic GitHub Pages deploy

Every push to `main` runs `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`, which builds
`dist/` and publishes it to GitHub Pages at
`https://theoretic.github.io/XCGram/plugin.min.js` (see [Install](#install-hosted)).
No manual step — just push.

- One-time setup: repo **Settings → Pages → Source = "GitHub Actions"**.
- `npm ci` in the workflow needs the committed `package-lock.json` — it is tracked.
- **Bump `version` in `src/pluginConfig.ts` per release**, or Windy serves a cached
  copy of the previous bundle.
- Editing files under `.github/workflows/` requires a token with `workflow` scope.

## Notes & limitations

- **Never name a top-level identifier `W`** — Windy's loader binds every
  `@windy/*` import to a global `W`; a module-scope `W` shadows it and the plugin
  throws *"Cannot access 'W' before initialization"* on load.
- The moist-adiabat ascent and CAPE/CIN are pragmatic approximations — good for
  reading the soaring day, not for research.
- Map overlays cost one forecast fetch per grid point; large grids over wide
  areas can hit Windy's rate limits. Start with **S**/**M**.
- Available pressure levels and the deepest forecast horizon depend on the chosen
  model (ECMWF, GFS, ICON-EU, ICON-D2, AROME).

Built on the [Windy plugin template](https://github.com/windycom/windy-plugin-template).
Inspired by the late, much-loved *Better Soundings* (sdg) plugin.
